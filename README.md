## Abstract
A tensor display, which consists of a few light attenuating layers stacked in front of a backlight, has potential to visualize a light field with high quality. A Raytrix camera is a focused plenoptic camera and has many advantages, such as higher spatial resolution and ability to capture light field videos, compared to traditional plenoptic cameras. In this paper, we established a process pipeline from capturing data by a Raytrix cameara to displaying it on a tensor display. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we conducted both computer simulations and experiments on a prototype display.

## Dataset
Because the size of our dataset is too large, we only uploaded some samples. If you need our full dataset, please send a email to ouyangwz@fujii.nuee.nagoya.ac.jp.

## Source code
We implemented our source code on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. (The code should work on OSX/Ubuntu with minimal modification)

Note: our source code is still in original version, and we will revise it in the future.

## Citation
If you use this code for your research, please cite our paper.
