# Abstract
A tensor display, which consists of a few light attenuating layers stacked in front of a backlight, has potential to visualize a light field with high quality. A Raytrix camera is a focused plenoptic camera and has many advantages, such as higher spatial resolution and ability to capture light field videos, compared to traditional plenoptic cameras. In this paper, we established a process pipeline from capturing data by a Raytrix cameara to displaying it on a tensor display. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we conducted both computer simulations and experiments on a prototype display.
